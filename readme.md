# This is my first online project - bullet king

I am making a game which the player,or the ball, needs to dodge the bullet or projectile. On the way, there will be power ups to collect. The longer you last, the higher the score you will get and will also get coins to upgrade the power-ups

## How to play?

Your objective is to survive as long as possible - by dodging the bullet asteroids and projectiles.

## Controls

'w' or up arrow = up

'a' or left arrow = left

'd' or right arrow = right

's' or down arrow = down

'w' + 'd' or up arrow and right arrow = up right

## Details
- 3 lives
- upgrades
- power-ups
- score
